# Hardware 

## How to Connect and Launch 

### 1. Go to the Hub & "Plateau Pédagogique"
Choose a PC with a TurtleBot3. 
On that PC, connect the associated TP-Link and follow the instructions to connect to the TurtleBot3. 

The setup should look something like this.
```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.0.200
```
Password: **napelturbot** 

### 2. Clone the GitHub repository on the TurtleBot3
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Tom11111110/Projet-sensor-based-controll.git tb3_ws
```
### 3. Build the workspace and source the setup file
```bash
cd tb3_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```
### 4. Launch the TurtleBot3 Then run:
```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
```
This will activate the TurtleBot3 and start the necessary nodes. This window publishes topics like /odom, /cmd_vel, etc., and keeps the robot active. 

### 5. Launch the RNFTSMC Controller Open another terminal, SSH if necessary, and source the workspace:
```bash
cd ~/tb3_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run tb3_rnftsmc rnftsmc_controller
```
⚠️ Note: You now have two terminals running: 
- TurtleBot3 nodes
- RNFTSMC controller 

## Results and Video

Here is a video showing the TurtleBot3 in action with multiple tests, including perturbations applied by hand and with a blower.  
You can observe how the RNFTSMC controller reacts in real time.
