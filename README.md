# Robust Nonlinear Controller for a Two-Wheeled Mobile Robot

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a **robust nonlinear controller** for a two-wheeled mobile robot. The main goal is to make the robot follow a **circular trajectory** while handling external disturbances, ensuring stable and accurate motion.

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Software:** Simulations and algorithm development performed on a computer, including Matlab simulations and ROS 2 virtual testing.
   *(For detailed steps and results, see [Software.md](Software.md))*

2. **Hardware:** Implementation on a physical robot (TurtleBot3), including real-time ROS 2 execution, robot control, and demonstration videos.
   *(For detailed steps and results, see [Hardware.md](Hardware.md))*

This structure allows for a smooth transition from simulation to real-world experimentation, ensuring that the controller is robust and reliable before deployment on the actual robot.
